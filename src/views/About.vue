    <p>
      I am an accomplished Software Developer with 7+ years of experience in the
      Information Technology industry. Proficient in C#, Angular, Vue.js and Web
      Development technologies such as HTML 5, CSS and TypeScript. An “Out of
      the box thinker” that thrives in remedying problem scenarios and
      situations.
    </p>
    <p>
      My professional journey has one way or another brought me into contact
      with a number of working environments, particularly high-paced and/or
      process driven environments. As a result, I’m able to create and also
      redefine processes to suit the needs of any organization.
